git hub tutorial for the food oasis group

Skylar from food oasis reporting for duty. When im not doing XIM, I like to go find some of the best cookies in the city and eat them. 
Some of my other favorite foods are al pastor tacos, lobster mac and cheese, and smoothies. I am an official memebr of the Beyhive (it actually comes with perks sometimes).
